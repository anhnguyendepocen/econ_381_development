A function, not too much different than a mathematical function, can take inputs, and then provides ideally one output. The output is called the return. In programming, it is strongly recommended, and typically the professional standard in programming, to have every function to do one and only one thing. When a function is simple and performs only one task this is called __modularization__. In python there are two kinds of functions, a __block function__, and a inline function which is usually called a __lambda function__ in Python.\n",
