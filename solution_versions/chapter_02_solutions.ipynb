    "The numbers are different because many consumer goods— food, haircuts, and medical visits— are very cheap in India when you are measuring in U.S. dollars. This is usually true in poor countries. As we see in Chapter 20, when we look at The Economist’s “Big Mac Index” of exchange rates, the same McDonald’s hamburger is much cheaper in poor countries than in rich countries when you compare prices in U.S. dollars. Wages, rents, and taxes cost less in poor countries, which makes it cheaper to produce a hamburger or a haircut or even a doctor’s visit. That means that although India is a very poor country, the Indian economy is not one- tenth the size of the U.S. economy. It is closer to one- third."
