    "## Learning How to Solve Systems of Equations in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In economics, often we want to know the solution to equalibrium values, i.e. price and quantity. To solve for these, we know that it is possible to set up a system of equations to solve for such values using two equations. As preparation for future assignments you will learn how to solve a system of equations in python. Follow the steps below to complete the task. \n",
