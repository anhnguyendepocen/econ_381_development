## Instructions on Using Git

Before each time you work on the project, ensure you have the latest version by pulling the repo from github. You can do this through the GUI or you can do this from the command line by moving into the proper directory and running `git pull`.

Upon finishing your work please add, commit, and push all your work ensuring you leave a detailed commit message about the files you worked on. You can do this through the GUI or you can run these in the command line:

+ `git add .`
+ `git commit -m "Your message here between quotes"`
+ `git push -u origin master`

If you ever have any complications, sometimes the best thing to do is make copies of the files you have worked on and then re-clone the repo to a new place on your computer and then replace the files in the repo with the ones you have worked on.
