    "__(a)__ What is potential output in 2018? You could call this a trick question, since there's no way for you to know the answer! In a way, that's the main point: fundamentally, we have to take some other measurements and make some assumptions. Suppose your research assistant tells you that in 2018, business surveys, unemplyment reports, and recent years' experience suggest that the economy is operationg at potential output. So go ahead and write 18.0 for potential output in this year. \n",
