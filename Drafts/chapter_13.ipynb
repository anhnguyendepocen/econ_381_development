    "We want to put the aggregate demand/supply model into the computer. First question should be putting it into the computer. A lot less hand holding, and they should now be able to create the graphs for the time-series plots. They should be able to put the time series model. Let’s decide if they will be dynamic, because we don’t want to teach them dynamic systems if it’s not in the book. Plot the static model and if we can plot the time series let’s do that too then. Even if it’s uninteresting, it’s good to have the graphs in front of us. \n",

Compare two plots back to back (replot), so they must recreate the plot they created in the first question and create the new plot and compare them side by side. Same idea of question 09.\n",
