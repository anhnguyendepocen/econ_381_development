    "\n",
    "In 2015, the U.S. National Income Accounts began to \"count\" intellectual property products—such as R&D, computer software, books, music, and movies—explicitly as investment. More correctly, they had previously assumed these products were an intermediate good that depreciated fully when used to produce some other final good, but now they are included as a part of investment and GDP. Examine the data on investment in intelectual property products (IPP).\n",

    "   * In past assignmets data was posted on Git Hub for you to download. This time will be different. You will be importing the data straight from a file on your computer.\n",

    "   * Begin by downloading the data to your computer from FRED as instructed in part __(a)__ by selecting download and then selecting the CSV (data) option. The file will be named Y001RE1Q156NBEA.csv.\n",
    "   * Once you have downloaded the data you will need to located where the data was downloaded. This will typically be in your Downloads folder on your computer. Take the .csv file from your Downloads and move it to a different folder such as a folder for this class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * A file path to such a folder for this class might look like C:\\Users\\Moncayo\\Documents\\BYU-I\\Fall 2018\\Econ 381 for windows. For Mac the file path might be /home/moncayo/Documents/BYU-I/Fall 2018/Econ 381. The slashes simply tell the computer to move into that folder.

    "   * If your Pandas data import does not work you may have misspelled a word, not capitalized something that should be, put an unnessesary space, or the file path you have does not actually lead to where the .csv file is actually stored. Check all these things if it does not work.\n",
