Suppose, the economy begins on a balanced growth path in the year $t=0$ and  the parameters of the model take the following values $\\bar{A_0} = 100$, $\\bar{\\ell} = 0.06$, $\\bar{z} = \\frac{1}{3000}$, $\\alpha=1/3$, and $\\bar{L} = 1000$. Plot a graph showing how each of the following events changes the output per capita series independent of each other (multiple series, each showing the consequences of one event) and then all together (plot only one series showing the combined effect of all the events): a doubling of the initial stock of knowledge $\\bar{A_0}$ at $t=20$, a doubling of the research share $\\bar{\\ell}$ at $t=40$, a doubling of research productivity $\\bar{z}$ at $t=60$, and a doubling of the population $\\bar{L}$ at $t=80$.\n",
